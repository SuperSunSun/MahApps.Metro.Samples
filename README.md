MahApps.Metro.Samples
=====================

### About

This repository will be used to keep a collection of sample applications (which were previously kept in the [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) repository) as a handy reference.

Why?

 - Easier to follow - rather than have 1 or 2 projects that demonstrate everything, break it out and make each demo more concise
 - Separate the core library from the rest - demos can reflect real-world apps at their own pace
 - Different audience - got something you'd like to show off?  

### Samples

First off I'd like to bring out these samples from the core library:

 - Restyling the default controls
 - Using the custom controls - progress bars, toggle switches, tiles, flyouts
 - Using the Pivot control to build out your app
 - Using the Panorama control to build out your app
 - Using the accents to set the theme of an application
